# Name
Melbourne Markets

# Description
Personal project work in progress created for the purpose of finding and filtering information about markets around Melbourne.

## Reflection
This is my first project using a framework over vanillaJS, CSS frameworks and databases. Sveltekit was easy to use and great to help keep my code neat and maintainable. It was a rewarding challenge that taught me how to utilise components, routes, databases and API integration. I also was able to practice my front end skills in creating responsive, accessible and clean UI. 

## Need help
The biggest challenge is figuring out how to store information so that on the details page refresh, will reload the previously viewed market. Have attempted to use stores.js and localStorage with little progress.

## Technology
* Sveltekit frontend framework
* CSS tailwind
* Postgres database

## Features
* Display responsive cards for each market
* Multiple filters based on market type, location, (date filter yet to build)
* Details page of each market includes
*   image carousel
*   description and details of market
*   interactive google map location using API integration
